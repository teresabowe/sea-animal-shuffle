# Sea Animal Shuffle

The Sea Animal Shuffle game site intends to help users develop their logical thinking skills. It is targeted at children from 5+ years of age up to adults. The user must find the correct sequence for the four images presented. The correct sequence has already been chosen by a random computer shuffle.

## Features

### Existing Features

__Header__

- The header shows the name at the top of the page. This name: Sea Animal Shuffle, communicates the purpose to the user.
- The font chosen is Fredoka, a large, rounded style font introducing a fun element to the game.
- The user then sees an instruction on how to play the game. For example, "figure out the sequence by clicking on the images".
- The user can click on the start button to start the game. The game also initialises on the document load. This option allows the user to begin a new game at any time.

__Image Selection Area__

- The onclick event for image selection is pre-loaded on the document load. The user can click on each image and toggle through the four images of fish, octopus, crab, and seahorse.
- If the user does not click on any images, they are accepted because the array is already pre-populated with the presented order.
- The submit button click event is also pre-loaded on document load. Once the user clicks on the submit button, the image selection is compared against the random computer shuffle. This shuffle is generated by using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

__Game Results__

- The user image choice is checked to ensure that there is one of each image selected. If not, the user receives an alert to indicate which sea animal is missing.

![Alert-One of each Sea Animal](/docs/one-of-each-sea-animal.png)

- Also, if there are correctly chosen images, the user receives feedback by having a border added around the sea animal. If the selection is correct, the border area is highlighted in green, and the incorrect images highlighted in red.

- The user choice is also cloned and presented below the user choice.

![Cloned area below the user choice](/docs/cloned-area.png)

- The game continues as the user selects new image sequences and clicks on the submit button.
- Once the user has selected the correct sequence, the alert will congratulate the user, and the images are highlighted in green.

![Green-border](/docs/successful-selection-green-border.png)

- At this point, the image onclick and submit button click are disabled. The user can click the start button to reload the page to begin a new game.
- The game terminates if the user does not guess the correct sequence within 26 attempts.

### Features Left to Implement

Add an additional level where the number of images presented to the user is five.

## Testing

Initially, all device testing was simulated on the Developer Tools on Google Chrome Version Version 102.0.5005.63. As each feature of the product was being developed, it was tested on Google Chrome to check that it was functioning correctly and also that the responsiveness was as expected.

### Responsiveness

Further manual testing for responsiveness was completed using Developer Tools on Google Chrome and physical devices. The results are shown below.

### Bugs

During development and testing, it became apparent that the toggleImage function was not performing as it should. The problem arose when the counter number was equal to the counter number on the if/if else statement while at the same time the image previously selected was the same as that shown on the if/if else statement. The impact for the user was that they would need to click twice to move the image along. While it would be intuitive for the user to click twice if the image did not change, it was decided to attempt to fix this issue. The best solution was to replace the counter and the if statement section of the toggleImage function with a simpler method of changing the image. The changes are shown in the code snippet below.

Counter method.

Direct image replacement method.

### Validator Testing 

__HTML__
- When the code is passed through the official W3C Validator, there are currently no errors or warnings showing.

__CSS__
- When the code is passed through the official CSS W3C Jigsaw Validator, there are currently no errors showing. There is one warning stating that "Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes". I understand that this is related to the use of Google Fonts font family.

__Javascript__
- When the code is passed through the official JSHint validator, there are currently no errors or warnings showing.

### Lighthouse Assessment

The Chrome Lighthouse tool was used to check performance, accessibility, best proctice, and SEO. The current results are shown below:
