# Sea Animal Shuffle

The Sea Animal Shuffle game site intends to help users develop their logical thinking skills. It is targeted at children from 5+ years of age up to adults. The user must find the correct sequence for the four images presented. The correct sequence has already been chosen by a random computer shuffle.

## Features

### Existing Features

__Header__

- The header shows the name at the top of the page. This name: Sea Animal Shuffle, communicates the purpose to the user.
- The font chosen is Fredoka, a large, rounded style font introducing a fun element to the game.
- The user then sees an instruction on how to play the game. For example, "figure out the sequence by clicking on the images".
- The user can click on the start button to start the game. The game also initialises on the document load. This option allows the user to begin a new game at any time.

__Image Selection Area__

- The onclick event for image selection is pre-loaded on the document load. The user can click on each image and toggle through the four images of fish, octopus, crab, and seahorse.
- The submit button click event is also pre-loaded on document load. Once the user clicks on the submit button, the image selection is compared against the random computer shuffle. This shuffle is generated by using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

__Game Results__

- The user image choice is checked to ensure that there is one of each image selected. If not, the user receives an alert to indicate which sea animal is missing.

- Also, if there are correctly chosen images, the user receives feedback by having a border added around the sea animal. If the selection is correct, the border area is highlighted in green, and the incorrect images highlighted in red.

- The user choice is also cloned and presented below the user choice.
